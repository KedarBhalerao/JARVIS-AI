This is a AI Personal Assistant. This is as same as our google assistant. This program is completely developed in Python. It hold much more feature.

As we know Python is a suitable language for script writers and developers. Let’s write a script for Personal Voice Assistant using Python. The query for the assistant can be manipulated as per the user’s need.

The implemented assistant can open up the application (if it’s installed in the system), search Google, Wikipedia and YouTube about the query, calculate any mathematical question, etc by just giving the voice command. We can process the data as per the need or can add the functionality, depends upon how we code things.
